# EDA

This directory contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) of various components of the AML project.  Plots here are messy, and ideas may be partially thought-out. 

Folders include: 

* abundances - some plotting of cluster abundances 
* emd_signaling_paired - some experimentation and plotting of the earth mover's distance (EMD) of signaling distributions between different stim conditions in the data set's paired samples
* expression_paired - same as above, but using raw expression values across a small sample of markers.
